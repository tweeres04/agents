# Global Agent Instructions

This document provides instructions that apply across all of Tyler's projects.

## Git Workflow

- Do not commit or push to `main` unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Each feature/task requires separate, explicit permission to commit and push.
- Previous "ship it" instructions do NOT carry over to new features.
- When in doubt, ASK before committing — even if the user's intent seems clear.
- "Commit this" for one set of changes does NOT grant permission for subsequent commits.

## Formatting Preferences

- **Headlines and titles:** Use sentence case (e.g., "Income just hit?" not "Income Just Hit?")
  - This applies to ad copy, landing page headlines, and marketing content
