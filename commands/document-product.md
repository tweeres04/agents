Explore this codebase to understand what the product does and who it's for. Focus on:

1. Main routes and user-facing features
2. Landing page / home page content and marketing copy
3. Database schema to understand the data model
4. Meta descriptions, page titles, testimonials

Then update AGENTS.md with a concise "What is [ProductName]?" section near the top (after the title, before technical details). Include:

- What the app does (1-2 sentences)
- Who it's for (target users)
- Key features as bullet points (3-5 items)
- Product positioning (what makes it different)

Keep it brief (10-15 lines) - just enough context for agents to understand the product, not a full marketing document.

If a "What is..." section already exists, update it rather than duplicating.
